		<p><p class="italic"></p>"Eco-Friendly, state-of-the-art- Dog Daycare, Grooming Spa and Pet Boutique, loctaed in the Financial District."</p>
		<h1 style="text-align: center"><strong>History</strong></h1>
		<p>Sara DeLaney, Ciao Bow Wow’s founder, has lived in the Financial District for many years, and watched the transformation of Manhattan’s oldest banking neighborhood into a vibrant, residential community– a community with lots of dogs! While wonderful new restaurants and gourmet food stores opened, and wine shops and dry cleaners appeared, nothing was opening for the downtown canine community. Sara has two dogs of her own, and knew something was missing.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Ciao Bow Wow was born from Sara’s love of dogs, and what she recognized to be much needed services for the Financial District’s dog-owning residents and their pups.</p>
		<p>What came next was study and training. Sara traveled the country studying with the nation’s experts in dog behavior, communication, and off-leash group play, including Robin Bennett, a pioneer in dog daycare, lecturer, and author of acclaimed books in the field; and Susan Briggs, another renowned dog daycare pioneer, author, and creator of the Standards for Dog Daycares adopted by the American Boarding and Kennel Association. As members of ABKA, we follow these standards, along with the ABKA’s Code of Ethics.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To enhance the physical and emotional health of every canine client.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Standards</strong></h2>
		<p>Every member of our daycare staff is trained in off-leash group play. The health and safety of the dogs in our care is our utmost priority, and this can only be realized by trained professionals. Our certified groomers have years of experience, and a tender touch, which makes them beloved by their clients, and invaluable members of our team.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Our facility itself is safe and healthy for your dog. Our floors are made of natural, resilient materials, and we use only natural cleaning products with no toxic chemicals. We have plenty of natural light and fresh air.  We are both an indoor park and a second home for your pup.</p>
